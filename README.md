# vim no-swaps

A swap is a file who thinks he's fly<br/>
And is also known as a backup<br/>
Always talkin' about what he wants<br/>
And just sits on his broke ass<br/>
So (no)<br/>

I don't want recover (no)<br/>
I don't want to write to file and (no)<br/>
I don't want to see you nowhere (no)<br/>
I don't want none of your time and (no)<br/>

I don't want no swap<br/>
A swap is a file that can't get no love from me<br/>
Hanging out the passenger side<br/>
Of his best friend's ride<br/>
Trying to holler at me<br/>
I don't want no swap<br/>
